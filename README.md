# Dice Game
#### A simple dice game for two players. Each player rolls the dices until either a 1 is rolled, a double 6 is rolled, or the player decides to "hold" their score. The player who first reaches the winning score wins. 

## Description
This is a dice game where two players roll dices until they achieve a specific score they define before starting the game. The player who reaches that score wins.

The rules of the game are:
* When the player rolls the dices, the score is added to their current score and they can continue to roll the dices or “hold” their current score.
* When the player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their total score, and it activates the next player's turn.
* If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score but keep their total score, and it switches to the next player’s turn.
* If a player rolls a double 6, they lose both current AND total score. They lose everything and it activates the next player’s turn.
